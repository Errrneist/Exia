# 在python中不需要声明数据类型
# 解释器自动推断出保存数据的准确类型
name = '江泽民'  # This is a string

isMale = True  # This is a boolean, in Python we need to claim True / False.
height = 1.99  # This is a float, equal to double in Java (It looks like any zero after decimal doesn't display well)
weight = 75.0  # Also a float.
