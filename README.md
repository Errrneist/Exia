* Trinnect is a website and domain that I bought and test all kinds of experiments. It is currently hosting on a respberry pi machine test server.
* Currently, the structure is HTML based and made possible using HTML template.
#### Project Elder
* As a fan of the man who changed China, I made a website devote to HIM. The structure and most of the contents of the project was finished on 2016.08.17 which is HIS 90th birthday. This project might be taken out as a own repository. This is the previous elder.hk and is now a sub page under trinnect.com due to funding. The origional domain and host server was shut down due to lacck of funding.
