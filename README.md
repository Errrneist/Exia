# Project Trinnect
* Developer: Hongjun Wu

## Web Design
### Website Development
#### Project Trinnect
* Trinnect is a website and domain that I bought and test all kinds of experiments. 
* It is currently hosting on a respberry pi machine test server. 
* Currently, the structure is HTML based and made possible using HTML template.
* No backend support added in yet.
#### [Project Elder](https://github.com/Errrneist/Trinnect/tree/master/Elder)
* As a fan of the MAN who changed China, I made a website devote to HIM. 
* The structure and most of the contents was finished on 2016.08.17 which is HIS 90th birthday. 
* This is the previous elder.hk and is now a sub page under trinnect.com due to lack of funding. 
* Videos are missing due to volume constraint. But if you are high level enough you can find it online.

## Python
